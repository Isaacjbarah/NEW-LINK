    <h3>Warming Tempatures and Wildfires</h3>
    <p> Warming temperatures, The temperature in the United States is rising every year and we see that with each
        summer that goes by. For example, 2023 broke a record for having the warmest year ever recorded. Which isnâ€™t
        surprising since we have avoided this issue. Just wait for the 2024s summer.

      <h3>Ecosystems</h3>
      <p>Ecosystems are also being affected by climate change, one of the most common ecosystems is the ice glaciers
          in the Antarctic that are home to the polar bears. With the temperature rise, more and more ice is
          being melted, leaving hundreds of polar bears needing a new home.

        <h3>Winter</h3>
        <p>Connecting back to rising temperatures we see a large decrease in snow these past years. The amount of
            snow is nothing compared to previous years, last year it only snowed about 2 inches which is insane.
            With the continued increase in temp, it might stop snowing at all in nyc.
