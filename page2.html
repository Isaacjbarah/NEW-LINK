    <h1>The Causes Of Climate Change</h1>
    <p> There are many different ways that climate change is caused. So here are some of the main causes of climate
      change. </p>

      <h3>Burning Fossil Fuels</h3>
      <p> Fossil fuels, especially in America, are the biggest reason why climate change is so bad. America alone
        contributes 14% of gas emissions in the entire world, which puts us in the top 3 countries that emit gas into
        the atmosphere. The debate over the solutions to climate change has been debated for years, and now we are
        seeing the effects of it. 2023 breaks a record for being the warmest year on record. If last summer was super
        hot, wait until you see it this summer. </p>

      <div class="course-col">
        <h3>Deforestaion/Forest Fires</h3>
        <p> Deforestation/Forest Fires is another big issue that needs to be addressed. Trees are a storage for carbon
          dioxide, which is what we need to survive, but when thousands of trees are being cut down. It releases that
          carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We saw what happened when Canada had a huge forest fire that traveled to
          America. The effects of the forest fires were so bad that schools were forced to close.

        <div class="course-col">
          <h3>Industry</h3>
          <p> Many industries are again another major problem that needs fixing. Industries around the country emit
            a long range of greenhouse gasses into the air. One example is when oil companies go bankrupt, they
            leave hundreds of oil wells wide open. Releasing large amounts of methane into the air, which is much
            worse than other gasses.

        <h3>Warming Tempatures and Wildfires</h3>
        <p> Warming temperatures, The temperature in the United States is rising every year and we see that with each
            summer that goes by. For example, 2023 broke a record for having the warmest year ever recorded. Which isnâ€™t
            surprising since we have avoided this issue. Just wait for the 2024s summer.
            </p>

        <div class="course-col">
          <h3>Ecosystems</h3>
          <p>Ecosystems are also being affected by climate change, one of the most common ecosystems is the ice glaciers
              in the Antarctic that are home to the polar bears. With the temperature rise, more and more ice is
              being melted, leaving hundreds of polar bears needing a new home.
          </p>

          <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Winter</h3>
            <p>Connecting back to rising temperatures we see a large decrease in snow these past years. The amount of
                snow is nothing compared to previous years, last year it only snowed about 2 inches which is insane.
                With the continued increase in temp, it might stop snowing at all in nyc.
